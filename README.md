#### features
+ copypasta technology

+ no complicated process - just send ether!

# GET YOUR **PETERCOIN** - send ether to `0xE3aBc03D7dfFaf6d5C2De4Aa822B21Fb9c13C86c`!

How I set it up from [here](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/a-101-noob-intro-to-programming-smart-contracts-on-ethereum-695d15c1dab4):
+ install `truffle` and `testrpc`
+ run `truffle init` in new directory
+ put contract in `contracts` folder created
+ add contract name to "contracts" in `config/app.json`
+ open a new window and start up etherum node with `testrpc`
+ run `truffle deploy` in the root of your project
